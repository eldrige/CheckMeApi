      "There's some evidence that hormonal contraception, which includes birth control pills and IUDs that release hormones, increases the risk of breast cancer. But the risk is considered very small, and it decreases after you stop using hormonal contraceptives.A recent study that showed an association between hormonal contraceptive use and breast cancer determined one additional breast cancer could be expected for every 7,690 women who use hormonal contraception for at least one year. Discuss your contraceptive options with your doctor. Also consider the benefits of hormonal contraception, such as controlling menstrual bleeding, preventing an unwanted pregnancy, and reducing the risk of other cancers, including endometrial cancer and ovarian cancer.",

      '<p>Breast cancer. Just reading those words can make many women worry. And that&rsquo;s natural.</p><p>Nearly everyone knows someone touched by the disease.</p><p>But there is a lot of good news about breast cancer these days. Treatments keep getting better, and we know more than ever about ways to prevent the disease. These eight simple steps can help lower the risk of breast cancer. Not every one applies to every woman, but together they can have a big impact.</p><p>1. Keep Weight in Check It&rsquo;s easy to tune out because it gets said so often, but maintaining a healthy weight is an important goal for everyone. Being overweight can increase the risk of many different cancers, including breast cancer, especially after menopause.</p><p>2. Be Physically Active Exercise is as close to a silver bullet for good health as there is, and women who are physically active for at least 30 minutes a day have a lower risk of breast cancer. Regular exercise is also one of the best ways to help keep weight in check.</p><p>3. Eat Your Fruits &amp; Vegetables &ndash; and Limit Alcohol (Zero is Best) A healthy diet can help lower the risk of breast cancer. Try to eat a lot of fruits and vegetables and limit alcohol. While moderate drinking can be good for the heart in older adults, even low levels of drinking can increase the risk of breast cancer. And with other risks of alcohol, not drinking is the overall healthiest choice.</p><p>4. Don&rsquo;t Smoke On top of its many other health risks, smoking causes at least 15 different cancers &ndash; including breast cancer. If you smoke, try to quit as soon as possible. It&rsquo;s almost never too late to get benefits. You can do it. And getting help can double your chances of quitting for good: visit smokefree.gov or call 800-QUIT-NOW (in IL 866-QUIT-YES).</p><p>5. Breastfeed, If Possible Breastfeeding for a total of one year or more (combined for all children) lowers the risk of breast cancer. It also has great health benefits for the child. For breastfeeding information or support, contact your pediatrician, hospital or local health department.</p><p>6. Avoid Birth Control Pills, Particularly After Age 35 or If You Smoke Birth control pills have both risks and benefits. The younger a woman is, the lower the risks are. While women are taking birth control pills, they have a slightly increased risk of breast cancer. This risk goes away quickly, though, after stopping the pill. The risk of stroke and heart attack is also increased while on the pill &ndash; particularly if a woman smokes. However, long-term use can also have important benefits, like lowering the risk of ovarian cancer, colon cancer and uterine cancer &ndash; not to mention unwanted pregnancy &ndash; so there&rsquo;s also a lot in its favor. If you&rsquo;re very concerned about breast cancer, avoiding birth control pills is one option to lower risk.</p><p>7. Avoid Menopausal Hormone Therapy Menopausal hormone therapy shouldn&rsquo;t be taken long term to prevent chronic diseases. Studies show it has a mixed effect on health, increasing the risk of some diseases and lowering the risk of others. And both estrogen-only hormones and estrogen-plus-progestin hormones increase the risk of breast cancer. If women do take menopausal hormone therapy, it should be for the shortest time possible. The best person to talk to about the risks and benefits of menopausal hormone therapy is your doctor.</p>',

      'World Cancer Day(WCD)  is intended to increase global awareness of cancer each year by education about cancer, and pressing governments and individuals across the world to take action against the disease. However, the WCD is more than a day on the calendar. That’s why our mobile application (CheckMe) is built to inspire change and mobilize action long after the day itself. A multi-year campaign means more exposure and engagement, more opportunities to build global awareness and ultimately more impact. Although breast cancer awareness has improved over the past decade, there are still misconceptions about the disease; the reason why we will be looking at some facts and dangers of breast cancer that are not known by the majority of the population.✓Women have a higher risk of developing breast cancer than men.This is due to the fact that their breast cells are constantly exposed to the growth-promoting effects of the female hormones estrogen and progesterone.✓Younger women or women below the age of 45 are also at a risk of attaining breast cancer.Although as you get older your risk of developing breast cancer increases, it’s important to be aware of your risk factors regardless of your age. Diagnosing breast cancer in women under 40 years old is more difficult, because their breast tissue is generally denser than in older women. Many younger women ignore the warning signs such as a breast lump or unusual nipple discharge because they believe they are too young to get breast cancer. Ignorance of this has contributed to the increase of prevalent cases in the smaller age groups.✓Genetics play a big role in your cancer risk.It is estimated that inherited genetic mutations account for between 5 and 10 percent to as many as 27 percent of all breast cancers. Inherited mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes account for many of the cases.BRCA1 and BRCA2 are two genes that are important to fighting cancer. They are tumor suppressor genes. When they work normally, these genes help keep breast, ovarian, and other types of cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way. Having a mother, sister or daughter with breast cancer doubles your risk of having the disease.✓Previous treatment using radiation therapy. Women who had radiation therapy to the chest or breasts such as radionuclide therapy and Brachytherapy under 30 years of age are at a higher risk of having Breast cancer in the years ahead. Overall, contributing to the late introduction of breast cancer cases is the need for instructive programs on breast self-examination and screening advances such as mammography. Also inaccessible standard strategies of treatment such as radiation, chemotherapy, and hormone receptor test. The prognosis for ladies with breast cancer in sub-Saharan Africa is very destitute due to the progressed organization of most cases, the need of treatment alternatives, impoverished medicare supplies, lacking transportation, and a deficiency of trained personnel.',
